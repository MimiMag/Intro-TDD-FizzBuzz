# TDD - FizzBuzz

>To get a better understanding of TDD and to refresh my Ruby knowledge, I have followed [this](https://blog.makersacademy.com/an-introduction-to-tdd-in-ruby-72f0a8536509) nice tutorial where I build a Fizzbuzz.

## The FizzBuzz Rules:
1) The program can be passed a number
2) When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'
3) When passed number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
4) When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'FizzBuzz'
5) In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number

## The TDD rules
1) Write a failing test
2) Write the simples code possible to pass teh test
3) Refactor

You should both write production code that fully meets the expectation of your test, and write tests that fully meet the specification of the program.
